What we have done so far
######################

1. Core Backend Architecture

Designed and scaffolded a modular Django backend under backend/apps/ with four key apps:
apps/
 ┣ institutes/  → Institute, Department, Course, Subject, Faculty, Student
 ┣ scheduler/   → TimeSlot, Infra, FacultyUnavailability, Occupancy
 ┣ users/       → User model with role-based access (Admin, HOD, Faculty, Student)
 ┗ api/         → REST API layer (Django REST Framework)


Each app has:

models.py for database schema
serializers.py (to be extended)
views.py with DRF ViewSets
urls.py connected via a global router

⚙️ 2. Database Configuration

✅ Connected your backend to PostgreSQL (Neon.tech) using:
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(
        os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'),
        conn_max_age=600,
        ssl_require=True
    )
}

✅ Successfully ran migrations
✅ Database is ready for multi-institute and multi-department scalability

🌐 3. REST API Setup

✅ Integrated Django REST Framework
✅ Registered all models via routers at /api/
✅ Confirmed working endpoints:
/api/institutes/
/api/departments/
/api/timeslots/
/api/occupancies/
/api/users/

👥 4. Authentication Layer

✅ Extended Django’s AbstractUser → created a custom User model with:

Role field (Admin, HOD, Faculty, Student)
Foreign keys to Institute and Department
This paves the way for role-based access control and dashboard segregation.

🧠 5. Project Readiness for AI Integration

✅ Added scheduler/utils/ placeholder for Google OR-Tools / OptaPlanner logic.
This will later handle constraint-based timetable generation.

What's next???
#############

1. Test CRUD — open /api/institutes/ or /api/departments/ in your browser or Postman and try creating a record.
2. Add serializers & permissions (if not yet implemented) to control data access by role.
3. Integrate OR-Tools logic into the scheduler/utils/ module later for timetable generation.
