### 5. Occupancy Table (Actual Timetable)

| Field | Data Type | Constraint | Value By | Remark |
|-------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| event_id | int | not null | System | Primary key, count |
| room_id | int | not null | AI | Foreign key, default primary sorting |
| timeslot_id | int | not null | AI | Foreign key, default secondary sorting |
| subject_id | int | not null | AI | Foreign key |
| faculty_id | int | not null | AI | Foreign key |
| student_group_id | int | not null | AI | Foreign key |
| status | dropdown | not null | System | `available` / `booked` / `blocked` (e.g., maintenance) |

#### 🔒 Constraints

1. `room_id` and `timeslot_id` cannot both be identical for two rows → no duplicate slot-room entries.  
2. If two rows have the same `faculty_id` but different `room_id`, their `timeslot_id` must differ (faculty cannot be in two rooms at once).  
3. Rule #2 also applies to `student_group_id` (a student group can’t attend two classes at once).  
4. `faculty_id` and `student_group_id` must correspond to the same `subject_id`.  
5. If status is `available`, assigning valid `faculty_id`, `student_group_id`, and `subject_id` updates status → `booked`.  
   - Do not update if status is `booked` or `blocked`.  
   - When backtracking = true → reset these fields and revert status to `available`.
